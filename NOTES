TODO:
1. Use spring security to store session for customer
2. Create customer-service which is just entering details for customer
3. Adding tests for whatever is required
4. We should save ticketCreated details in database
5. How to write pact tests between the two services
6. Better name than timestamp
7. Should we have 2 ticketCreated events and ticketCreated entity?
